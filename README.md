a coin flipping website where the webpage ask for choice and notes point for true answer, but the project is made useless by only landing on the  opposite side as the user selects

What if your decision-making skills were so good that they didnâ€™t matter at all?
Imagine a website that lets you pick heads or tailsâ€”just for the thrill of itâ€”only to defy your choice every single time. No matter how confident you are, it lands on the opposite side!

Introducing "Reverse Coin Flip"â€”the coin-flipping website where your choice is bound to be wrong, every single time. Say goodbye to luck and hello to disappointment! Itâ€™s an experience so meaningless, it's almost meaningful
